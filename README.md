# Linear Algebra
This is a series of notebooks used to formalise knowledge regarding linear algebra (and mess around with cool python tools!).

I wanted to make this for myself, as I frequently end up learning and re-learning various linear algebra concepts for my other projects, and I thought it might be an interesting way to document knowledge :)
